        <h6 class="text-center text-white mt-2 p-0 llc-text">The LLC is a top choice for smaller businesses due to its
            cost-effectiveness and easy management. Often recommended by C Corps and S Corps, it offers limited
            liability protection, keeping business liabilities separate. Additionally, LLC enjoys 'pass-through'
            taxation, exempt from federal income tax.</h6>
