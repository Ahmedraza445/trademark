            <h1>LLC (Limited Liability Company)</h1>
            <p>The LLC is a top choice for smaller businesses due to its
                cost-effectiveness and easy management. Often recommended by C Corps and S Corps, it offers limited
                liability protection, keeping business liabilities separate. Additionally, LLC enjoys 'pass-through'
                taxation, exempt from federal income tax.</p>
