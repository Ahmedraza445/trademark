                        <p>Sellers who join the Amazon trademark Registry get better trademark security. This protects
                            their registered brand on Amazon and prevents other sellers from using it to sell products.
                            Sellers who have trademark security in place can focus on expanding their brand without
                            worrying about infringement or unauthorized use of their brand name.</p>
